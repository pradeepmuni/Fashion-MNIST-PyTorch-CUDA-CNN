# Fashion-MNIST-PyTorch-CUDA-CNN
For this project we'll work with the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist'>Fashion-MNIST</a> dataset, also available through <a href='https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html'><tt><strong>torchvision</strong></tt></a>. Like MNIST, this dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes:
0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
7. Sneaker
8. Bag
9. Ankle boot


In this classification, we aim to correctly identify the object from a dataset of tens of thousands of images by using the Convolutional Neural Network(PyTorch)
